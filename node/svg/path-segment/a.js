 * A and a: (from www.w3.org)
 *
 * params: rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y
 *
 * Draws an elliptical arc from the current point to (x, y). The size and
 * orientation of the ellipse are defined by two radii (rx, ry) and an
 * x-axis-rotation, which indicates how the ellipse as a whole is rotated
 * relative to the current coordinate system. The center (cx, cy) of the ellipse
 * is calculated automatically to satisfy the constraints imposed by the other
 * parameters. large-arc-flag and sweep-flag contribute to the automatic
 * calculations and help determine how the arc is drawn.
